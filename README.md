# 1-Refactor-HTML

## Description

This is project is refactoring a webpage in order to make it more accessable. This is done by making sure that all links work, and adding descriptive properties to the code as well as to the assets. This will allow users to utalize the web page even with a screen reader. We are learning to understand the code and it's actual purpose, because, in order to modify it, you need to understand what each asset is doing.
